# BwZero bootstrap compiler

A birdway compiler written in Rust (because it shares some syntax and concepts
with Birdway). The goal here is to have an implementation of the version 0.1 of
the language ASAP. The code will not be an exmaple of good rust code as I will
write to look like birdway code to simplify the future rewrite of the compiler
in Birdway.
