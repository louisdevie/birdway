  Task
  Draw a rotating cube.
  It should be oriented with one vertex pointing straight up, and its opposite vertex on the main diagonal (the one farthest away) straight down. It can be solid or wire-frame, and you can use ASCII art if your language doesn't have graphical capabilities. Perspective is optional.
