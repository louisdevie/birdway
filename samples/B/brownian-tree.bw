  Brownian tree

  Task
  Generate and draw a Â  Brownian Tree.
  A Brownian Tree is generated as a result of an initial seed, followed by the interaction of two processes.
  Because of the lax rules governing the random nature of the particle's placement and motion, no two resulting trees are really expected to be the same, or even necessarily have the same general shape.
