  Bitcoin/address validation

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Bitcoin/address_validation

  
  Task
  Write a program that takes a bitcoin address as argument,
and checks whether or not this address is valid.
  A bitcoin address uses a base58 encoding, which uses an alphabet of the characters 0 .. 9, A ..Z, a .. z, but without the four characters:
  0   zero
   O   uppercase oh
   I   uppercase eye
   l   lowercase ell
  With this encoding, a bitcoin address encodes 25 bytes:
  To check the bitcoin address, you must read the first twenty-one bytes, compute the checksum, and check that it corresponds to the last four bytes.
  The program can either return a boolean value or throw an exception when not valid.
  You can use a digest library for SHA-256.
  
  Example of a bitcoin address
  
  
  It doesn't belong to anyone and is part of the test suite of the bitcoin software.
You can change a few characters in this string and check that it'll fail the test.
