  Execute SNUSP

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Execute_SNUSP

  An implementation need only properly implement the Core SNUSP instructions ('$', '\', '/', '+', '-', '<', '>', ',', '.', '!', and '?'). Modular SNUSP ('#', '@') and Bloated SNUSP (':', ';', '%', and '&') are also allowed, but not required. Any extra characters that you implement should be noted in the description of your implementation. Any cell size is allowed, EOF support is optional, as is whether you have bounded or unbounded memory.
