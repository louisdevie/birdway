  Empty directory

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Empty_directory

  Starting with a path to some directory, determine whether the directory is empty.
  An empty directory contains no files nor subdirectories.
With Unix or Windows systems, every directory contains an entry for “.” and almost every directory contains “..” (except for a root directory); an empty directory contains no other entries.
