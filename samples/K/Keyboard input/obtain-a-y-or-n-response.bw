  Task
  Obtain a valid Y or N response from the keyboard.
  The keyboard should be flushed, so that any outstanding key-presses are removed,
  preventing any existing Y or N key-press from being evaluated.
  The response should be obtained as soon as Y or N are pressed,
  and there should be no need to press an enter key.
