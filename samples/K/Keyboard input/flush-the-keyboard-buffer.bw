  Keyboard input/Flush the keyboard buffer

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Keyboard_input/Flush_the_keyboard_buffer

  Flush the   keyboard   buffer.
  This reads characters from the keyboard input and
discards them until there are no more currently buffered,  
and then allows the program to continue.
  The program must not wait for users to type anything.
