  Tokenize a string

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Tokenize_a_string

  Separate the string "Hello,How,Are,You,Today" by commas into an array (or list) so that each element of it stores a different word.
  Display the words to the 'user', in the simplest manner possible, separated by a period.
  To simplify, you may display a trailing period.
