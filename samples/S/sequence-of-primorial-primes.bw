  Sequence of primorial primes

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sequence_of_primorial_primes

  The sequence of primorial primes is given as the increasing values of n where primorial(n) Â± 1 is prime.
  Noting that the n'th primorial is defined as the multiplication of the smallest n primes, the sequence is of the number of primes, in order that when multiplied together is one-off being a prime number itself.
  
  Task
  Generate and show here the first ten values of the sequence.
  
  Optional extended task
  Show the first twenty members of the series.
