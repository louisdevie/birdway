  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Integer_comparison

  Get two integers from the user.
  Then,   display a message if the first integer is:
  less than, 
   equal to,   or 
   greater than
  the second integer.
  Test the condition   for each case separately,   so that   all three comparison operators are used   in the code.
