  Loops/Wrong ranges

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Loops/Wrong_ranges

  
  Some languages have syntax or function(s) to generate a range of numeric values from a start value, a stop value, and an increment.
  The purpose of this task is to select the range syntax/function that would generate at least two increasing numbers when given a stop value more than the start value and a positive increment of less than half the difference. Â  You are then to use that same syntax/function but with different parameters; and show, here, what would happen.
  Use these values if possible:
  
  start stop increment comment

  -2    2    1         Normal 

  -2    2    0         Zero increment 

  -2    2    -1        Increments away from stop value 

  -2    2    10        First increment is beyond stop value 

  2     -2   1         Start more than stop: positive increment 

  2     2    1         Start equal stop: positive increment 

  2     2    -1        Start equal stop: negative increment 

  2     2    0         Start equal stop: zero increment 

  0     0    0         Start equal stop equal zero: zero increment
