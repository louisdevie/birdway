  Loops/Foreach

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Loops/Foreach

  Loop through and print each element in a collection in order.
  Use your language's "for each" loop if it has one, otherwise iterate
  through the collection in order with some other loop.

func main() -> {
    let dark_side = ["MEMBER", "GROUP", "SCHOOL", "ITEM", "BLOCK", "Scavengers"]

    for org in dark_side do {
        println org;
    };
};
