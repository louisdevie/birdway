  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Loops/Do-while

  Start with a value at 0. Loop while value mod 6 is not equal to 0.
  Each time through the loop, add 1 to the value then print it.
  The loop must execute at least once.

func main() -> {
    let i = 0;
    do {
        i = i + 1;
        println i;
    }
    until i%6 == 0;
}
