  Loops/Nested

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Loops/Nested

  Show a nested loop which searches a two-dimensional array
  filled with random numbers uniformly distributed over [ 1, â€¦, 20 ].

  The loops iterate rows and columns of the array printing the elements
  until the value 20 is met.
  Specifically, this task also shows how to break out of nested loops.
