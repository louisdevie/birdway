  Task
  Explicitly implement   long multiplication.
  This is one possible approach to arbitrary-precision integer algebra.
  For output, display the result of    264 * 264.
  Optionally, verify your result against builtin arbitrary precision support.
  The decimal representation of    264    is:
  The output of    264 * 264    is    2128,    and is:
