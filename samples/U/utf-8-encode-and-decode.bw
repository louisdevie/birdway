  UTF-8 encode and decode

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/UTF-8_encode_and_decode

  As described in UTF-8 and in Wikipedia, UTF-8 is a popular encoding of (multi-byte) Unicode code-points into eight-bit octets.
  The goal of this task is to write a encoder that takes a unicode code-point (an integer representing a unicode character) and returns a sequence of 1-4 bytes representing that character in the UTF-8 encoding.
  Then you have to write the corresponding decoder that takes a sequence of 1-4 UTF-8 encoded bytes and return the corresponding unicode character.
  Demonstrate the functionality of your encoder and decoder on the following five characters:
  Provided below is a reference implementation in Common Lisp.
