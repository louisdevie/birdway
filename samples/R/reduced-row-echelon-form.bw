  Task
  Show how to compute the reduced row echelon form
(a.k.a. row canonical form) of a matrix.
  The matrix can be stored in any datatype that is convenient
(for most languages, this will probably be a two-dimensional array).
  Built-in functions or this pseudocode (from Wikipedia) may be used:
  For testing purposes, the RREF of this matrix:
  is:
