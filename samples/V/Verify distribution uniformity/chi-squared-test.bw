  Verify distribution uniformity/Chi-squared test

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Verify_distribution_uniformity/Chi-squared_test

  Task
  Write a function to verify that a given distribution of values is uniform by using the 




χ

2




{\displaystyle \chi ^{2}}

 test to see if the distribution has a likelihood of happening of at least the significance level (conventionally 5%).
  The function should return a boolean that is true if the distribution is one that a uniform distribution (with appropriate number of degrees of freedom) may be expected to produce.
