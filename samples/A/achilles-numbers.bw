  Achilles numbers

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Achilles_numbers

  An Achilles number is a number that is powerful but imperfect. Named after Achilles, a hero of the Trojan war, who was also powerful but imperfect.
  A positive integer n is a powerful number if, for every prime factor p of n, p2 is also a divisor.
  In other words, every prime factor appears at least squared in the factorization.
  All Achilles numbers are powerful. However, not all powerful numbers are Achilles numbers: only those that cannot be represented as mk, where m and k are positive integers greater than 1.
  A strong Achilles number is an Achilles number whose Euler totient (ùúë) is also an Achilles number.
  
  E.G.
  108 is a powerful number. Its prime factorization is 22 √ó 33, and thus its prime factors are 2 and 3. Both 22 = 4 and 32 = 9 are divisors of 108. However, 108 cannot be represented as mk, where m and k are positive integers greater than 1, so 108 is an Achilles number.
  360 is not an Achilles number because it is not powerful. One of its prime factors is 5 but 360 is not divisible by 52 = 25.
  Finally, 784 is not an Achilles number. It is a powerful number, because not only are 2 and 7 its only prime factors, but also 22 = 4 and 72 = 49 are divisors of it. Nonetheless, it is a perfect power; its square root is an even integer, so it is not an Achilles number.
  500 = 22 √ó 53 is a strong Achilles number as its Euler totient, ùúë(500), is 200 = 23 √ó 52 which is also an Achilles number.
