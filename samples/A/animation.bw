  Animation

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Animation

  Animation is integral to many parts of GUIs, including both the fancy effects when things change used in window managers, and of course games.   The core of any animation system is a scheme for periodically changing the display while still remaining responsive to the user.   This task demonstrates this.
  
  Task
  Create a window containing the string "Hello World! " (the trailing space is significant).
  Make the text appear to be rotating right by periodically removing one letter from the end of the string and attaching it to the front.
  When the user clicks on the (windowed) text, it should reverse its direction.
