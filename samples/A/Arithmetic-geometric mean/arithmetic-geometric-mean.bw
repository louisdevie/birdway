  Arithmetic-geometric mean

  Task
  Write a function to compute the arithmetic-geometric mean of two numbers.
  The arithmetic-geometric mean of two numbers can be (usefully) denoted as 




a
g
m

(
a
,
g
)


{\displaystyle \mathrm {agm} (a,g)}

, and is equal to the limit of the sequence:
  a

0


=
a
;


g

0


=
g


{\displaystyle a_{0}=a;\qquad g_{0}=g}


 




a

n
+
1


=



1
2



(

a

n


+

g

n


)
;


g

n
+
1


=



a

n



g

n




.


{\displaystyle a_{n+1}={\tfrac {1}{2}}(a_{n}+g_{n});\quad g_{n+1}={\sqrt {a_{n}g_{n}}}.}
  Since the limit of 




a

n


âˆ’

g

n




{\displaystyle a_{n}-g_{n}}

 tends (rapidly) to zero with iterations, this is an efficient method.
  Demonstrate the function by calculating:
  a
g
m

{\displaystyle \mathrm {agm} (1,1/{\sqrt {2}})}
