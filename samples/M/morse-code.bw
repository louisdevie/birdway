  Morse code

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Morse_code

  It has been in use for more than 175 years — longer than any other electronic encoding system.
  
  Task
  Send a string as audible Morse code to an audio device   (e.g., the PC speaker).
  As the standard Morse code does not contain all possible characters,
you may either ignore unknown characters in the file,
or indicate them somehow   (e.g. with a different pitch).
