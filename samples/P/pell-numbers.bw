  Pell numbers

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Pell_numbers

  Pell numbers are an infinite sequence of integers that comprise the denominators of the closest rational approximations to the square root of 2 but have many other interesting uses and relationships.
  The numerators of each term of rational approximations to the square root of 2 may also be derived from Pell numbers, or may be found by taking half of each term of the related sequence: Pell-Lucas or Pell-companion numbers.
  The Pell numbers: 0, 1, 2, 5, 12, 29, 70, etc., are defined by the recurrence relation:
  Or, may also be expressed by the closed form formula:
  Pell-Lucas or Pell-companion numbers: 2, 2, 6, 14, 34, 82, etc., are defined by a very similar recurrence relation, differing only in the first two terms:
  Or, may also be expressed by the closed form formula:
  or
  
  The sequence of rational approximations to the square root of 2 begins:
  Starting from n = 1, for each term, the denominator is Pn and the numerator is Qn / 2 or Pn-1 + Pn.
  
  Pell primes are Pell numbers that are prime. Pell prime indices are the indices of the primes in the Pell numbers sequence. Every Pell prime index is prime, though not every prime index corresponds to a prime Pell number.
  
  If you take the sum S of the first 4n + 1 Pell numbers, the sum of the terms P2n and P2n + 1 will form the square root of S.
  For instance, the sum of the Pell numbers up to P5; 0 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 12 + 29 == 49, is the square of P2 + P3 == 2 + 5 == 7. The sequence of numbers formed by the sums P2n + P2n + 1 are known as Newman-Shank-Williams numbers or NSW numbers.
  
  Pell numbers may also be used to find Pythagorean triple near isosceles right triangles; right triangles whose legs differ by exactly 1. E.G.: (3,4,5), (20,21,29), (119,120,169), etc.
  For n > 0, each right triangle hypotenuse is P2n + 1. The shorter leg length is the sum of the terms up to P2n + 1. The longer leg length is 1 more than that.
