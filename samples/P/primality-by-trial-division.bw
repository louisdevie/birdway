  Primality by trial division

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Primality_by_trial_division

  Task
  Write a boolean function that tells whether a given integer is prime.
  Remember that   1   and all non-positive numbers are not prime.
  Use trial division.
  Even numbers greater than   2   may be eliminated right away.
  A loop from   3   to   √ n    will suffice,   but other loops are allowed.
