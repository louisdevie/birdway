  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Primality_by_Wilson%27s_theorem

  Task
  Write a boolean function that tells whether a given integer is prime using Wilson's theorem.
  By Wilson's theorem, a number p is prime if and only if p divides (p - 1)! + 1.
  Remember that 1 and all non-positive integers are not prime.
