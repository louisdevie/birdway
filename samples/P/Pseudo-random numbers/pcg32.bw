  Some definitions to help in the explanation
  Floor operation
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions
Greatest integer less than or equal to a real number.
  Bitwise Logical shift operators (c-inspired)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#Bit_shifts
Binary bits of value shifted left or right, with zero bits shifted in where appropriate. 
Examples are shown for 8 bit binary numbers; most significant bit to the left.
  << Logical shift left by given number of bits.
E.g Binary 00110101 << 2 == Binary 11010100
  >> Logical shift right by given number of bits.
E.g Binary 00110101 >> 2 == Binary 00001101
  ^ Bitwise exclusive-or operator
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or
Bitwise comparison for if bits differ
E.g Binary 00110101 ^ Binary 00110011 == Binary 00000110
  | Bitwise or operator
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR
Bitwise comparison gives 1 if any of corresponding bits are 1
E.g Binary 00110101 | Binary 00110011 == Binary 00110111
  
  PCG32 Generator (pseudo-code)
  PCG32 has two unsigned 64-bit integers of internal state:
  Values of sequence allow 2**63 different sequences of random numbers from the same state.
  The algorithm is given 2 U64 inputs called seed_state, and seed_sequence. The algorithm proceeds in accordance with the following pseudocode:-
  Note that this an anamorphism â€“ dual to catamorphism, and encoded in some languages as a general higher-order `unfold` function, dual to `fold` or `reduce`.
  Task
  numbers using the above.
  are: 2707161783 2068313097 3122475824 2211639955 3215226955
  
  Is as follows:
