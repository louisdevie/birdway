  Probabilistic choice

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Probabilistic_choice

  Given a mapping between items and their required probability of occurrence, generate a million items randomly subject to the given probabilities and compare the target probability of occurrence versus the generated values.
  The total of all the probabilities should equal one. (Because floating point arithmetic is involved, this is subject to rounding errors).
