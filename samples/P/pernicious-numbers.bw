  Pernicious numbers

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Pernicious_numbers

  A   pernicious number   is a positive integer whose   population count   is a prime.
  The   population count   is the number of   ones   in the binary representation of a non-negative integer.
  
  Example
  22   (which is   10110   in binary)   has a population count of   3,   which is prime,   and therefore
22   is a pernicious number.
