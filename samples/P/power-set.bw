  Power set

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Power_set

  A   set   is a collection (container) of certain values,
without any particular order, and no repeated values.
  It corresponds with a finite set in mathematics.
  A set can be implemented as an associative array (partial mapping)
in which the value of each key-value pair is ignored.
  Given a set S, the power set (or powerset) of S, written P(S), or 2S, is the set of all subsets of S.
  
  Task
  By using a library or built-in set type, or by defining a set type with necessary operations, write a function with a set S as input that yields the power set 2S of S.
  For example, the power set of     {1,2,3,4}     is
  {{}, {1}, {2}, {1,2}, {3}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}, {4}, {1,4}, {2,4}, {1,2,4}, {3,4}, {1,3,4}, {2,3,4}, {1,2,3,4}}.
  For a set which contains n elements, the corresponding power set has 2n elements, including the edge cases of empty set.
  The power set of the empty set is the set which contains itself (20 = 1):
  P




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}}

(



∅


{\displaystyle \varnothing }

) = { 



∅


{\displaystyle \varnothing }

 }
  And the power set of the set which contains only the empty set, has two subsets, the empty set and the set which contains the empty set (21 = 2):
  P




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}}

({



∅


{\displaystyle \varnothing }

}) = { 



∅


{\displaystyle \varnothing }

, { 



∅


{\displaystyle \varnothing }

 } }
  Extra credit:  Demonstrate that your language supports these last two powersets.
