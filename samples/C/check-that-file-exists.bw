  Check that file exists

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Check_that_file_exists

  === Task ===
  Verify that a file called input.txt and a directory called docs exist.
  This should be done twice:
  once for the current working directory, and
  once for a file and a directory in the filesystem root.
  Optional criteria (May 2015): verify it works with:
  zero-length files
  an unusual filename: `Abdu'l-BahÃ¡.txt
