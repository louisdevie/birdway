  Create a file

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Create_a_file

  In this task, the job is to create a new empty file called "output.txt" of size 0 bytes
  and an empty directory called "docs". This should be done twice: once "here",
  i.e. in the current working directory and once in the filesystem root.

func main() -> {
    -- create an empty file
    open("output.txt", CREATE)::close();

    -- create a directory
    mkdir("docs");
}
