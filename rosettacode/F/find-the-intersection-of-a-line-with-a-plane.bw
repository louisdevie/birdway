  Finding the intersection of an infinite ray with a plane in 3D is an important topic in collision detection.
  
  Task
  Find the point of intersection for the infinite ray with direction   (0, -1, -1)   passing through position   (0, 0, 10)   with the infinite plane with a normal vector of   (0, 0, 1)   and which passes through [0, 0, 5].
