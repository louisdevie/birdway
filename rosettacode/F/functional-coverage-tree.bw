  Functional coverage tree

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Functional_coverage_tree

  Functional coverage is a measure of how much a particular function of a system
has been verified as correct. It is used heavily in tracking the completeness
of the verification of complex System on Chip (SoC) integrated circuits, where
it can also be used to track how well the functional requirements of the
system have been verified.
  This task uses a sub-set of the calculations sometimes used in tracking
functional coverage but uses a more familiar(?) scenario.
  Task Description
  The head of the clean-up crews for "The Men in a very dark shade of grey when
viewed at night" has been tasked with managing the cleansing of two properties
after an incident involving aliens.
  She arranges the task hierarchically with a manager for the crews working on
each house who return with a breakdown of how they will report on progress in
each house.
  The overall hierarchy of (sub)tasks is as follows,
  The head of cleanup knows that her managers will report fractional completion of leaf tasks (tasks with no child tasks of their own), and she knows that she will want to modify the weight of values of completion as she sees fit.
  Some time into the cleaning, and some coverage reports have come in and she thinks see needs to weight the big house2 60-40 with respect to coverage from house1 She prefers a tabular view of her data where missing weights are assumed to be 1.0 and missing coverage 0.0.
  Calculation
  The coverage of a node in the tree is calculated as the weighted average of the coverage of its children evaluated bottom-upwards in the tree.
  The task is to calculate the overall coverage of the cleaning task and display the coverage at all levels of the hierarchy on this page, in a manner that visually shows the hierarchy, weights and coverage of all nodes.
  Extra Credit
  After calculating the coverage for all nodes, one can also calculate the additional/delta top level coverage that would occur if any (sub)task were to be fully covered from its current fractional coverage. This is done by multiplying the extra coverage that could be gained

 for any node, by the product of the `powers` of its parent nodes from the top down to the node.
The power of a direct child of any parent is given by the power of the parent multiplied by the weight of the child divided by the sum of the weights of all the direct children.
