  Harshad or Niven series

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Harshad_or_Niven_series

  The Harshad or Niven numbers are positive integers ≥ 1 that are divisible by the sum of their digits.
  For example,   42   is a Harshad number as   42   is divisible by   (4 + 2)   without remainder.
  Assume that the series is defined as the numbers in increasing order.
  
  Task
  The task is to create a function/method/procedure to generate successive members of the Harshad sequence.
  Use it to:
  list the first 20 members of the sequence,   and
   list the first Harshad number greater than 1000.
  Show your output here.
