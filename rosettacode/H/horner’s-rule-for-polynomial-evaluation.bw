  Horner's rule for polynomial evaluation

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Horner%27s_rule_for_polynomial_evaluation

  A fast scheme for evaluating a polynomial such as:
  −
19
+
7
x
−
4

x

2


+
6

x

3





{\displaystyle -19+7x-4x^{2}+6x^{3}\,}
  when
  x
=
3



{\displaystyle x=3\;}

.
  is to arrange the computation as follows:
  (
(
(
(
0
)
x
+
6
)
x
+
(
−
4
)
)
x
+
7
)
x
+
(
−
19
)



{\displaystyle ((((0)x+6)x+(-4))x+7)x+(-19)\;}
  And compute the result from the innermost brackets outwards as in this pseudocode:
  Task Description
  Create a routine that takes a list of coefficients of a polynomial in order of increasing powers of x; together with a value of x to compute its value at, and return the value of the polynomial at that value using Horner's rule.
