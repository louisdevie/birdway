  Greatest subsequential sum

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Greatest_subsequential_sum

  Task
  Given a sequence of integers, find a continuous subsequence which maximizes the sum of its elements, that is, the elements of no other single subsequence add up to a value larger than this one.
  An empty subsequence is considered to have the sum of   0;   thus if all elements are negative, the result must be the empty sequence.
