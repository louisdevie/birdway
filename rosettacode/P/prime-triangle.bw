  Prime triangle

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Prime_triangle

  You will require a function f which when given an integer S will return a list of the arrangements of the integers 1 to S such that g1=1 gS=S and generally for n=1 to n=S-1 gn+gn+1 is prime. S=1 is undefined. For S=2 to S=20 print f(S) to form a triangle. Then again for S=2 to S=20 print the number of possible arrangements of 1 to S meeting these requirements.
