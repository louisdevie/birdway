  Proper divisors

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Proper_divisors

  The   proper divisors   of a positive integer N are those numbers, other than N itself, that divide N without remainder.
  For N > 1 they will always include 1,   but for N == 1 there are no proper divisors.
  
  Examples
  The proper divisors of     6     are   1, 2, and 3.
The proper divisors of   100   are   1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, and 50.
