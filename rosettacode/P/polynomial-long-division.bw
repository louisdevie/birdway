  Polynomial long division

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Polynomial_long_division

  In algebra, polynomial long division is an algorithm for dividing a polynomial by another polynomial of the same or lower degree.
  Let us suppose a polynomial is represented by a vector, 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 (i.e., an ordered collection of coefficients) so that the 



i


{\displaystyle i}

th element keeps the coefficient of 




x

i




{\displaystyle x^{i}}

, and the multiplication by a monomial is a shift of the vector's elements "towards right" (injecting ones from left) followed by a multiplication of each element by the coefficient of the monomial.
  Then a pseudocode for the polynomial long division using the conventions described above could be:
  Note: vector * scalar multiplies each element of the vector by the scalar; vectorA - vectorB subtracts each element of the vectorB from the element of the vectorA with "the same index". The vectors in the pseudocode are zero-based.
  Example for clarification

This example is from Wikipedia, but changed to show how the given pseudocode works.
