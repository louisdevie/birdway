  The task is to write a program which generates such a number and prints a real representation of it. The code should be tested by calculating and printing the square root of 2, Napier's Constant, and Pi, using the following coefficients:
  For the square root of 2, use 




a

0


=
1


{\displaystyle a_{0}=1}

 then 




a

N


=
2


{\displaystyle a_{N}=2}

.

{\displaystyle b_{N}}

 is always

{\displaystyle a_{0}=2}

, then
