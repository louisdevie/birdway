  Conjugate transpose

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Conjugate_transpose

  Suppose that a matrix 



M


{\displaystyle M}

 contains complex numbers. Then the conjugate transpose of 



M


{\displaystyle M}

 is a matrix 




M

H




{\displaystyle M^{H}}

 containing the complex conjugates of the matrix transposition of 



M


{\displaystyle M}

.

{\displaystyle (M^{H})_{ji}={\overline {M_{ij}}}}
  This means that row 



j


{\displaystyle j}

, column 



i


{\displaystyle i}

 of the conjugate transpose equals the
complex conjugate of row 



i


{\displaystyle i}

, column 



j


{\displaystyle j}

 of the original matrix.
  In the next list, 



M


{\displaystyle M}

 must also be a square matrix.
  
  Task
  Given some matrix of complex numbers, find its conjugate transpose.
  Also determine if the matrix is a:
  Hermitian matrix,
 normal matrix, or 
 unitary matrix.
