  Longest increasing subsequence

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Longest_increasing_subsequence

  Calculate and show here a longest increasing subsequence of the list:
  {
3
,
2
,
6
,
4
,
5
,
1
}


{\displaystyle \{3,2,6,4,5,1\}}
  And of the list:
  {
0
,
8
,
4
,
12
,
2
,
10
,
6
,
14
,
1
,
9
,
5
,
13
,
3
,
11
,
7
,
15
}


{\displaystyle \{0,8,4,12,2,10,6,14,1,9,5,13,3,11,7,15\}}
  Note that a list may have more than one subsequence that is of the maximum length.
