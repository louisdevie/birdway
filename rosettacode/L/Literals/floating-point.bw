  Literals/Floating point

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Literals/Floating_point

  Programming languages have different ways of expressing floating-point literals.
  
  Task
  Show how floating-point literals can be expressed in your language: decimal or other bases, exponential notation, and any other special features.
  You may want to include a regular expression or BNF/ABNF/EBNF defining allowable formats for your language.
