  Latin Squares in reduced form/Randomizing using Jacobson and Matthewsâ€™ Technique

  Section 3.3 of [Generalised 2-designs with Block Size 3(Andy L. Drizen)] describes a method of generating Latin Squares of order n attributed to Jacobson and Matthews. The purpose of this task is to produce a function which given a valid Latin Square transforms it to another using this method.
  part 1
  Use one of the 4 Latin Squares in reduced form of order 4 as X0 to generate 10000 Latin Squares using X(n-1) to generate X(n). Convert the resulting Latin Squares to their reduced form, display them and the number of times each is produced.
  part 2
  As above for order 5, but do not display the squares. Generate the 56 Latin Squares in reduced form of order 5, confirm that all 56 are produced by the Jacobson and Matthews technique and display the number of each produced.
  part 3
  Generate 750 Latin Squares of order 42 and display the 750th.
  part 4
  Generate 1000 Latin Squares of order 256. Don't display anything but confirm the approximate time taken and anything else you may find interesting
