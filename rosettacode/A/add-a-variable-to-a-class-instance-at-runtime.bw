  Add a variable to a class instance at runtime

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Add_a_variable_to_a_class_instance_at_runtime

  Demonstrate how to dynamically add variables to an object (a class instance) at runtime.
  This is useful when the methods/variables of an instance are based on a data file that isn't available until runtime. Hal Fulton gives an example of creating an OO CSV parser at An Exercise in Metaprogramming with Ruby. This is referred to as "monkeypatching" by Pythonistas and some others.
