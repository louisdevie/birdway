  AKS test for primes

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/AKS_test_for_primes

  The AKS algorithm for testing whether a number is prime is a polynomial-time algorithm based on an elementary theorem about Pascal triangles.
  The theorem on which the test is based can be stated as follows:
  (
x
−
1

)

p


−
(

x

p


−
1
)


{\displaystyle (x-1)^{p}-(x^{p}-1)}
  are divisible by   



p


{\displaystyle p}

.
  
  Example
  Using   



p
=
3


{\displaystyle p=3}

:
  And all the coefficients are divisible by 3,   so 3 is prime.
