  Averages/Mean time of day

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Averages/Mean_time_of_day

  A particular activity of bats occurs at these times of the day:
  23:00:17, 23:40:20, 00:12:45, 00:17:19
  Using the idea that there are twenty-four hours in a day,
which is analogous to there being 360 degrees in a circle,
map times of day to and from angles;
and using the ideas of Averages/Mean angle
compute and show the average time of the nocturnal activity
to an accuracy of one second of time.
