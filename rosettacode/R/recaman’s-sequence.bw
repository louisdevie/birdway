  Recaman's sequence

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Recaman%27s_sequence

  The RecamÃ¡n's sequence generates Natural numbers.
  Starting from a(0)=0, the n'th term a(n), where n>0, is the previous term minus n i.e a(n) = a(n-1) - n but only if this is both positive and has not been previousely generated.
  If the conditions don't hold then a(n) = a(n-1) + n.
