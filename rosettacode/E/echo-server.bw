  Echo server

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Echo_server

  Create a network service that sits on TCP port 12321, which accepts connections on that port, and which echoes complete lines (using a carriage-return/line-feed sequence as line separator) back to clients. No error handling is required. For the purposes of testing, it is only necessary to support connections from localhost (127.0.0.1 or perhaps ::1). Logging of connection information to standard output is recommended.
  The implementation must be able to handle simultaneous connections from multiple clients. A multi-threaded or multi-process solution may be used. Each connection must be able to echo more than a single line.
  The implementation must not stop responding to other clients if one client sends a partial line or stops reading responses.
