  Eertree

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Eertree

  An eertree is a data structure designed for efficient processing of certain palindrome tasks, for instance counting the number of sub-palindromes in an input string.
  The data structure has commonalities to both tries and suffix trees.
Â  See links below.
  
  Task
  Construct an eertree for the string "eertree", then output all sub-palindromes by traversing the tree.
