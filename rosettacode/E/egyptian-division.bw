  Egyptian division

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Egyptian_division

  Egyptian division is a method of dividing integers using addition and
doubling that is similar to the algorithm of Ethiopian multiplication
  Algorithm:
  Given two numbers where the dividend is to be divided by the divisor:

  Answer
  So 580 divided by 34 using the Egyptian method is 17 remainder (578 - 580) or 2.
  
  Task
  The task is to create a function that does Egyptian division. The function should
closely follow the description above in using a list/array of powers of two, and
another of doublings.
