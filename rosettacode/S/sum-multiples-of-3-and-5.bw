  Sum multiples of 3 and 5

  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sum_multiples_of_3_and_5

  Task
  The objective is to write a function that finds the sum of all positive multiples of 3 or 5 below n.
  Show output for n = 1000.
  This is is the same as Project Euler problem 1.
  Extra credit: do this efficiently for n = 1e20 or higher.
