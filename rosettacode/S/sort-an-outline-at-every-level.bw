  Task
  Write and test a function over an indented plain text outline which either:
  
  Your code should detect and warn of at least two types of inconsistent indentation:
  Your code should be able to detect and handle both tab-indented, and space-indented (e.g. 4 space, 2 space etc) outlines, without being given any advance warning of the indent characters used, or the size of the indent units.
  You should also be able to specify different types of sort, for example, as a minimum, both ascending and descending lexical sorts.
  Your sort should not alter the type or size of the indentation units used in the input outline.
  (For an application of Indent Respectful Sort, see the Sublime Text package of that name. The Python source text [1] is available for inspection on Github).
  Tests
  The output sequence of an ascending lexical sort of each level should be:
  The output sequence of a descending lexical sort of each level should be:
