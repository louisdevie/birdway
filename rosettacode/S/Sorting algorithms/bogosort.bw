  Task
  Bogosort a list of numbers.
  Bogosort simply shuffles a collection randomly until it is sorted.
  "Bogosort" is a perversely inefficient algorithm only used as an in-joke.
  Its average run-time is   O(n!)   because the chance that any given shuffle of a set will end up in sorted order is about one in   n   factorial,   and the worst case is infinite since there's no guarantee that a random shuffling will ever produce a sorted sequence.
  Its best case is   O(n)   since a single pass through the elements may suffice to order them.
  Pseudocode:
  The Knuth shuffle may be used to implement the shuffle part of this algorithm.
