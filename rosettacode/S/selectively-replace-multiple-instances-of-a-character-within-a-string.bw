  Task
  This is admittedly a trivial task but I thought it would be interesting to see how succinctly (or otherwise) different languages can handle it.
  Given the string: "abracadabra", replace programatically:
  Note that there is no replacement for the third 'a', second 'b' or first 'r'.
  The answer should, of course, beÂ : "AErBcadCbFD".
