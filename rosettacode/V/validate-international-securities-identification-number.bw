  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Validate_International_Securities_Identification_Number

  An International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) is a unique international identifier for a financial security such as a stock or bond.
  
  Task
  Write a function or program that takes a string as input, and checks whether it is a valid ISIN.
  It is only valid if it has the correct format,   and   the embedded checksum is correct.
  Demonstrate that your code passes the test-cases listed below.
  
  Details
  The format of an ISIN is as follows:
  For this task, you may assume that any 2-character alphabetic sequence is a valid country code.
  The checksum can be validated as follows:

 Unfortunately, not all transposition typos are caught by the checksum constraint.
