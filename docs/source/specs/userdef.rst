User-defined types
==================

.. _enum:
Enumerations
------------

Enumerations are a set of values,
declared with the ``enum`` statement.

.. _struct:
Structures
----------

Structures are used to group together different types.
The ``struct`` statement is used to declare a structure.
Each field is named and has a non-generic type.
Structures can be created literally
using the syntax ``MyStruct (field1: value1, field2: value2)``.
