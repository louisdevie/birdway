A programming language for command-line applications

## Overview

**Status : Draft**

*Birdway* is a functional and imperative programming language, primarily meant
to create small command-line applications.
This language was created for my personal use
and to learn a thing or two about how compilers works.

## Features

* Immutability by default
* A very simple type system
* First-class / anonymous functions
* Full type inference
* Function overloading
* Command-line arguments parsing

## License

The source code of the compiler, the Sublime Text package and the documentation
are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
The code samples belongs to the public domain.
